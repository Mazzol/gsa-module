gsa-module
==========

``gsa-module`` is a Python3 package implementing several global sensitivity
analysis methods for computer/simulation experiments.
The implementation is based on a black-box approach where the computer model 
(or any generic function) is externally implemented to the module itself.
The module accepts the model outputs and the design of experiment (optional, 
only for certain methods) and compute the associated sensitivity measures.
The package also includes routines to generate normalized design of experiment 
file to be used in the simulation experiment based on several algorithms (such 
as simple random sampling or latin hypercube) as well as simple routines to 
post-processed multivariate raw code output such as its maximum, minimum, or
average. 

The general calculation flow chart involved in using the ``gsa-module`` can 
be seen in the figure below.

Features (v0.5.0)
-----------------

 - Capability to generate design of computer experiments using 4 different 
   methods: simple random sampling, latin hypercube sampling, sobol' sequence,
   and optimized latin hypercube using command line interface
 - Sobol' quasi-random number sequence generator is a wrapper around the 
   implementation by `Joe and Kuo (2008)`_. Two binaries are made available 
   for linux64 and windows64
 - Randomization of the Sobol' quasi-random number using random shift procedure
 - Optimization of the latin hypercube design is done via evolutionary 
   stochastic algorithm (ESE)
 - Generation of separate test points based on Hammersley quasi-random sequence

Requirements
------------

The module was developed and tested using the `Anaconda Python`_ distribution
of Python v3.5.
No additional package except the base installation of the distribution is required.

.. _Anaconda Python: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

To use generate the Sobol' sequence design, a binary version of the Sobol' 
sequence generator implementation of `Joe and Kuo (2008)`_ with an appropriate 
direction number file are required. The repository also includes two binaries
for linux64 and windows64.

Installation
------------

``gsa-module`` is hosted on `BitBucket`_.

.. _BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/lrs-uq/gsa-module

After cloning the source::

    git clone git@bitbucket.org:lrs-uq/gsa-module.git

the installation can be done easily from the local source directory::

    pip install -e .

This will make the following available in the path:

 - The python module ``gsa_module``
 - The executable ``create_sample``
 - The executable ``create_validset``

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for ``gsa-module`` is currently under construction.
