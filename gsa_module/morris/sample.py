    ************************

    Module implementing method to generate design of experiments specifically
    for Morris screening method

    Two flavors for generating design of experiment for Morris screening
    analysis are implemented:

    1. The trajectory design: the one proposed originally by Morris, also known
       as the winding stair design proposed by Jansen (although comes in a bit
       modified form)
    2. The radial design: the one proposed by Saltelli et al. that uses Sobol'
       low discrepancy sequence to build an OAT design. It is promoted because
       it remove the number of levels from the specification, thus reducing
       additional user-specified parameter
