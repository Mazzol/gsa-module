    ************************

    Module implementing method to generate design of experiments specifically
    for Morris screening method

    Two flavors for generating design of experiment for Morris screening
    analysis are implemented:

    1. The trajectory design: the one proposed originally by Morris [1], also
       known as the winding stair design proposed by Jansen [2] (although
       this one comes in a bit modified form)
    2. The radial design: the one proposed by Saltelli et al. [3] that uses
       Sobol' low discrepancy sequence to build an OAT design. It is promoted
       because it remove the number of levels from the specification,
       thus reducing additional user-specified parameter. Additionally, the
       size of grid jump will also vary from one nominal point to another
