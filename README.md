# Global Sensitivity Analysis Package

Python3 package to carry out Variance-based GSA.

**GSA-Module** is a python3 implementation of several global methods for 
sensitivity analysis.
The implementation is based on a black-box approach where the function 
is implemented externally to the module.  
Function here is defined in a generic term; it can be another code that 
gives an output for a given set of inputs.

## Scope
 
The package contains several sub-package to carry out this task:

1. `sample`: the package responsible to generate pseudorandom and/or
  low-discrepancy sequences
2. `qoi`: the package responsible to extract the quantity of interest 
  from a set of csv files
3. `sobol`: the package responsible to generate set of Sobol'-Saltelli
  sampling-resampling design matrices, read the set of csv output files,
  and calculate the 1st-order, 2nd-order, and total-order indices
4. `morris`: the package used to generate Morris trajectories matrix, read 
  the set of csv output files, and calculate the elementary effects and their
  statistics
5. `nonparam`: the package to calculate sensitivity measures based on quantities
  from non-parametric statistics, such as the rank correlation coefficient or
  the partial rank correlation coefficient
 
All of these packages as well as modules and functions within them are stiched
together with the use of *driver* script. 
A *driver* script is custom made and tailored for a certain analysis. 
The generic use of such script is exemplified as follow:
 
1. Generate design matrix, either for a specific application such as the 
  Sobol'-Saltelli and Morris, or for general purpose such as simple random
  sampling, latin hypercube, etc.
2. Use the design matrix to evaluate a function that produced an output in 
  a set of csv files. This function can simply be an external code as long 
  as the produced files are csv.
3. If the output is not directly a scalar, then the functions within the 
  `qoi` package can be used to post-process them further
4. From a set of csv files containing scalar output, the sensitivity measures
  can be computed (e.g., Sobol' indices, statistics of elementary effects, etc.)
