Funding
-------

``gsa_module`` is developed to support sensitivity analysis of model output, 
particularly from (though not stricted to) thermal-hydraulics system code, 
under a doctoral research project funded by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Lausanne;
carried out at the Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behaviour, Paul Scherrer Institut, in Villigen.
