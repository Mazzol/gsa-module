``gsa-module`` Package
======================

Welcome to the ``gsa-module`` package documentation, a python3 package to 
conduct global sensitivity analysis of model output.

If you're just getting started with ``gsa-module``, please start with 
:ref:`gsa_module_basics`.
If you're already familiar with it, refer to :ref:`gsa_module_user_guide`
and :ref:`gsa_module_reference` for further detail and reference.
If you're curious with some theories and detail of implementation 
behind global sensitivity analysis methods check the :ref:`gsa_module_implementation`.
Finally, if you're thinking to make modification or extend the capability of the package 
perhaps it is a good idea to check the :ref:`gsa_module_developer_guide`.
