# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

## [Unreleased]
- Update the module documentation

## [0.9.0] - 2017-05-04
### Added
- Add functionality to generate a set of Sobol'-Saltelli design matrices used 
  to compute the Monte Carlo estimates of first- and total- order sensitivity
- The generation of the design matrices are equipped with a command line 
  interface: `gsa_sobol_generate` executable
- Add functionality to estimate the first order sensitivity indices using two
  different estimator: Sobol'-Saltelli and Janon et al.
- Add functionality to estimate the total order sensitivity using the Jansen 
  estimator and Sobol-Homma Estimator
- The estimation also includes the bootstrap samples of each indices
- The computation of confidence interval (either moment based or percentile) 
  can be separately carried out using gsa_module.sobol.misc.bootstrap_ci() 
  function
- Fully tested on Ishigami and Sobol-G* functions, the results is documented

## [0.8.0] - 2017-04-09

### Added
- Add function to compute position factor, a simple and useful measure of 
  change in rank

### Changed
- the API for analyzing Morris results has been changed. There's only one 
  single main function for both trajectory and radial design.
  The function will detect by itself the kind of design.
- The function to compute the elementary effects will return the best-estimate
  of their statistics (mu, mu_star, and standard deviation) as well as the 
  bootstrap samples of the estimate. The bootstrap samples can be used to 
  compute confidence interval either percentile or moment (sigma)

### Fixed
- Fixed the issue with stability of linear solution when standardization 
  is used
- Fixed the same issue for trajectory design

## [0.7.1] - 2017-03-20

### Changed
- Default values for the built-in `dirnumfiles` = `new-joe-kuo-6.21201` is 
  asserted when the built-in Sobol' sequence generator is called 

### Fixed
- Fix the risk to have zero-valued rows in the perturbation matrix for 
  radial design used in the Morris method
- Fix the interface to generate Morris radial design calling the internally 
  implemented Sobol' sequence generator

## [0.7.0] - 2017-03-06

### Added
- Natively implement [Joe & Kuo] Sobol' sequence generator in Python. Pure 
  conversion from the C++ source code to Python.
  
### Deprecated
- The compiled C++ source code of `sobol.cc` is deprecated. Any reference 
  to call the wrapper to execute this executable in order to generate Sobol'
  sequence will be removed in the subsequent releases.

## [0.6.0] - 2017-03-06

### Added
- Capability to generate design of computer experiments for screening analysis
  (one-at-a-time, OAT, design) based on the trajectory desing (original Morris)
  and radial design (Saltelli et al.)
- Capability to compute the statistics of elementary effects, standardized or 
  otherwise, bot for trajectory and radial designs. The statistics (mean, mean 
  of absolute, and standard deviation) are used as the basis of parameter 
  importance ranking
- Update the module `sphinx-doc` documentation for the Morris method

## [0.5.3] - 2016-09-09

### Fixed
- Wrong implementation of random shifting the Sobol' sequence

## [0.5.2] - 2016-09-07

### Fixed
- Issue with trying to optimized LHS of dimension 1

## [0.5.1] - 2016-09-06

### Fixed
- Wrong implementation of random shifting the Sobol' quasi-random sequence

## [0.5.0] - 2016-09-06

### Added
- Generation of separate test points based on a given design using Hammersley
  quasi-random sequence

## [0.4.0] - 2016-09-06

### Added
- Randomization of the Sobol' quasi-random sequence using random shift 
  procedure

## [0.3.0] - 2016-08-31

### Added
- Optimization of the latin hypercube design is done via evolutionary 
  stochastic algorithm (ESE)
  
## [0.2.0] - 2016-08-30

### Added
- Sobol' quasi-random sequence generator is a wrapper around the implementation
  by [Joe & Kuo] (2008). Two binaries are made available for linux64 and 
  windows64
  
## 0.1.0 - 2016-11-23

### Added
- Capability to generate design of experiments using 4 different methods:
  simple random sampling (SRS) and latin hypercube sampling (LHS) using command
  line interface
